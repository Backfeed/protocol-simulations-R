R - simulations of the Backfeed protocol
------------------------------------------------

The R scripts in this repository allow for defining a scenario of consequential evaluations of contributions, executing the scenario and playing with different functions within the main "evaluate" function. At the end or during a simulation run plots can be made.

* **sim.R** - contains the simulation run.
* **evaluate.R** - contains the main evaluate function which updates the reputation of users as well as the contributions' data frame.
* **scenario.R** - defines all the relevant parameters as well as functional forms for the stake and the dividend.
